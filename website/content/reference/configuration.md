description: Where Tau stores state, and the shape of its config files.
---

Tau keeps durable state in your home directory (`~/.tau/`) and reads
project-local resources from your working directory. This page is a reference for
those locations and file formats.

## Tau home

```text

```

Tau also reads user-level `.agents` resources: `~/.agents/skills/`,
`~/.agents/prompts/`, `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`.

`settings.json` may contain `"defaultProjectTrust": "ask" | "always" |
"never"`. It is user-global only; a project cannot choose its own trust
policy. The default is `ask`. Interactive `ask` opens the trust modal; headless
`ask` safely declines. `trust.json` is managed atomically by Tau; do not add
relative paths or unknown fields. See [Project trust]({{< relref
"../guides/project-trust.md" >}}).

Startup update checks cache their latest PyPI result in
`~/.tau/cache/update-check.json` and refresh at most once per day. Set
`TAU_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable the check; Tau also skips it when `CI` is set.

`models-store.json` caches an ETag-revalidated models.dev catalog newer than the
bundled snapshot. `/model` refreshes it in the background at most every four
hours; `tau update --models` forces revalidation. Set `TAU_OFFLINE=1` to disable
catalog network access. User `catalog.toml` overrides still apply after the cache.

## System prompt files

Tau can replace or extend its generated system prompt with Tau-native Markdown
files:

```text
~/.tau/SYSTEM.md                 # user replacement
~/.tau/APPEND_SYSTEM.md          # user append
<project>/.tau/SYSTEM.md         # project replacement
<project>/.tau/APPEND_SYSTEM.md  # project append
```

Replacement inputs use precedence: explicit CLI input, then the project
`SYSTEM.md`, then the user `SYSTEM.md`. Append inputs compose instead of
shadowing one another: Tau adds the user `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, then the project
`APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, then every explicit `--append-system-prompt` value in CLI
order. Replacement content still receives all append text, project instructions,
eligible skills, the current date, and the working directory. Empty files are
valid contributions.

Run `/reload` after adding, changing, or removing a file. Tau rebuilds the prompt
for the next model request without adding it to session history. `/session`
resource diagnostics identify selected append files and selected, shadowed, or
CLI-overridden replacement files. A selected file that cannot be inspected or
decoded as UTF-8 stops startup or reload rather than silently falling back.

System prompt files are Tau-specific and are not discovered from `.agents`.
Project files load only after the destination cwd is trusted. User files and
explicit CLI values remain available when project inputs are declined. Trust is
an input-loading guard, not a sandbox; inspect trusted prompt files because they
can replace or extend the model's highest-priority instructions.

## Network proxies

Tau uses `httpx` for provider requests, OAuth token refreshes, and startup update
checks, so it honors standard proxy environment variables such as `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.

SOCKS proxies are supported by the base installation. Use explicit schemes when
you can:

```bash
export ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
# or, when proxy-side DNS resolution is required:
export ALL_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080
```

Tau also accepts the generic `socks://` form that some systems and tools set in
the environment. Before creating its own HTTP clients, Tau normalizes
`socks://...` to `socks5://...` because `httpx` does not recognize the generic
scheme directly.

This matters for users behind corporate proxies, VPNs, local tunnels, or
privacy/network-routing setups: without SOCKS support and normalization, Tau can
fail before making a model API request with an error like
`Unknown scheme for proxy URL URL('socks://...')`.

## Providers

Tau separates provider metadata from runtime preferences:

- `src/tau_coding/data/catalog.toml` ships the built-in provider/model catalog.
- `~/.tau/catalog.toml` optionally adds personal providers or overlays built-ins.
- `~/.tau/providers.json` stores runtime preferences such as the default provider,
  default model, scoped models, headers, and timeout/retry settings.

The built-in llama.cpp backend stores only its normalized endpoint and safe
server-reported model snapshot at `~/.tau/state/extensions/llama.cpp.json`.
Optional credentials remain in `credentials.json` or `LLAMA_API_KEY`; dynamic
llama.cpp provider definitions are not written to `catalog.toml` or
`providers.json`. Scoped llama.cpp entries in `providers.json` contain only the
stable `llama.cpp` provider ID and exact model ID; stale entries do not create
availability or router work. For Hugging Face GGUF search, Tau reads `HF_TOKEN`
or standard Hugging Face token files but never stores or forwards that token to
the llama.cpp server. The independent server needs its own `HF_TOKEN` for gated
downloads. See the [local inference guide]({{< relref
"../guides/local-inference.md" >}}).

Tau intentionally reads catalog overlays only from the user-level
`~/.tau/catalog.toml`. There is no project-level `.tau/catalog.toml`, so cloning a
repository cannot silently redirect a provider's `base_url` or credentials to an
unexpected service.

### Provider catalog overlays

Add reusable custom provider definitions to `~/.tau/catalog.toml`:

```toml
schema_version = 1

[[providers]]
name = "local-gateway"
display_name = "Local Gateway"
kind = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
api_key_env = "LOCAL_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
credential_name = "local-gateway"
models = ["qwen-coder"]
default_model = "qwen-coder"
docs_url = "https://example.test/local-gateway"

[providers.context_windows]
qwen-coder = 64000
```

Catalog entries support `kind` values of `openai-compatible`, `anthropic`, and
`openai-codex`. For most custom services, start with `openai-compatible`.

User catalog overlays can be partial when they use the same `name` as a built-in
provider. Scalar fields replace built-in values, `models` are merged with user
models first, and `context_windows` are merged. Provider-level `compat` is merged
key by key. Model metadata is merged by model;
its `headers`, `compat`, and `thinking_level_map` mappings are merged, while other
metadata fields—including the complete `cost_tiers` array—replace the built-in
value. A model's `compat` wins over the provider's, so a built-in per-model value
overrides a provider-level overlay — override at the model level to change it.

`removed_models` is an additive provider-scoped tombstone list. Tau applies it
last and removes matching model-list, metadata, context-window, thinking, and
default references after merging. Bundled tombstones therefore prevent stale
user overlays from restoring models that Tau previously advertised for the wrong
provider. They do not affect the same model ID on another provider.

### OpenAI prompt-cache compat keys

Tau enables OpenAI cache affinity automatically only for `api.openai.com` and the
dedicated Codex OAuth provider. OpenAI-compatible gateways can opt in per provider
or model:

| Key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `supportsPromptCacheKey` | Sends the stable session-derived `prompt_cache_key` body field |
| `sendSessionAffinityHeaders` | Sends headers using `sessionAffinityFormat` |
| `sessionAffinityFormat` | `openai` sends `session_id`; `openrouter` sends `x-session-id` |

Unknown gateways retain their existing request shape by default. Enable only fields
documented by the target service. Codex uses its dedicated `session-id` header
mapping and does not read these OpenAI-compatible settings.

### Anthropic prompt-cache compat keys

Providers using the `anthropic-messages` API accept three `compat` booleans
controlling prompt caching. All default to enabled, except that `cache_control` is
detected as unsupported for any base URL that is not `api.anthropic.com`, since
several providers speak the Anthropic protocol through a gateway.

| Key | Effect when `false` |
| --- | --- |
| `supportsCacheControl` | No cache breakpoints at all; the request is byte-identical to an uncached one |
| `supportsLongCacheRetention` | Clamps the 1 hour TTL to the 5 minute default |
| `supportsCacheControlOnTools` | Drops only the tool-schema breakpoint |

Set them per provider or per model. For example, to stop requesting the one-hour
cache on a Claude subscription:

```toml
schema_version = 1
[[providers]]
name = "anthropic"
compat = { supportsLongCacheRetention = false }
```

The thinking fields (`thinking_levels`, `thinking_models`,
`thinking_default`, `thinking_parameter`) replace as a group when
`thinking_levels` is present.

`catalog.toml` does not store runtime request options such as custom HTTP
headers, timeouts, or retry settings. Put those in `~/.tau/providers.json` on the
matching provider entry.

Invalid catalog files fail loudly. Tau rejects unknown keys, empty required
strings, empty model names, unsupported provider kinds, default models that are
not listed in `models`, `thinking_models` or `context_windows` entries for
unknown models, and non-positive or non-integer context-window values.

Model metadata can retain a backward-compatible flat `cost` and optionally
provide ordered `cost_tiers` for rates that depend on input size:

```toml
[providers.model_metadata."long-context-model"]
cost = { input = 0.3, output = 1.2, cacheRead = 0.06, cacheWrite = 0 }
cost_tiers = [
  { max_input_tokens = 512000, input = 0.3, output = 1.2, cacheRead = 0.06, cacheWrite = 0 },
  { input = 0.6, output = 2.4, cacheRead = 0.12, cacheWrite = 0 },
]
```

Limits are inclusive, must increase strictly, and the final tier must omit
`max_input_tokens` so every valid input size has a rate. Callers that understand
tiers should select the first tier whose limit includes the input-token count;
older callers continue to see `cost` as the base rate.

All rates are per million tokens. `cacheWrite` is the 5-minute cache-write
rate; entries may add an optional `cacheWrite1h` rate for Anthropic's 1-hour
TTL cache writes, which Anthropic bills higher. When `cacheWrite1h` is absent,
1-hour writes fall back to the `cacheWrite` rate.

### Provider preferences

Provider preferences live in `~/.tau/providers.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "default_provider": "local-gateway",
  "provider_preferences": {
    "local-gateway": {
      "default_model": "qwen-coder",
      "headers": { "X-Provider-Header": "value" },
      "thinking_defaults": { "qwen-coder": "low" },
      "timeout_seconds": 120,
      "max_retries": 2,
      "max_retry_delay_seconds": 0.5
    }
  },
  "scoped_models": [
    { "provider": "local-gateway", "model": "qwen-coder" }
  ]
}
```

- `provider_preferences` keys must refer to providers from the effective catalog
  (`src/tau_coding/data/catalog.toml` plus `~/.tau/catalog.toml`).
- `headers` is optional (string→string). For example, Hugging Face organization
  billing can be configured with `"headers": { "X-HF-Bill-To": "my-org" }` on
  the `huggingface` provider preference. `thinking_defaults` remembers the
  preferred thinking level per model for new sessions; resumed sessions still use
  their session history. The built-in `huggingface` preference also accepts
  `"inference_providers": { "zai-org/GLM-5.2": "deepinfra" }`. Each key must be
  a configured model and each value an explicit provider suffix advertised by
  Hugging Face—not the `fastest`, `cheapest`, or `preferred` routing policies.
  Tau snapshots the selected suffix into new session metadata as a fixed route,
  retains it on resume, and sends only the suffixed wire model; ordinary model
  identity and catalog metadata remain unsuffixed. Without a preference, Tau
  starts in automatic mode and records the `x-inference-provider` reported by
  the first successful response as a sticky but recoverable route. After a
  retryable pre-output HTTP failure exhausts provider-level retries, Tau clears
  that automatic pin, retries the interrupted turn once through Hugging Face
  automatic routing, and stores the successful replacement. Explicitly configured
  routes never fail over. `/session` reports both mode and current route; changing
  the active session route is available through the external
  [`tau-huggingface`](https://github.com/alejandro-ao/tau-huggingface) extension;
  clone it and launch Tau with `tau -e ./tau-huggingface`, then use `/hf route`.
  `timeout_seconds` defaults to `60` (> 0); `max_retries`
  defaults to `2`; `max_retry_delay_seconds` defaults to `1` (both ≥ 0).
  Retries cover transient HTTP statuses (`408`, `409`, `425`, `429`, `5xx`),
  transport errors, and transient in-stream SSE errors that arrive on an
  otherwise successful HTTP 200 response. Anthropic retries `api_error`,
  `overloaded_error`, and `rate_limit_error`; OpenAI Codex retries transient
  events such as `server_is_overloaded`. In-stream errors remain terminal after
  partial content to prevent duplicate output or tool calls. Existing session
  records that contain a Hugging Face route but predate route-mode metadata are
  treated as fixed, preventing an upgrade from overriding a potentially explicit
  user selection.
- API keys and OAuth credentials are **not** stored here — they live in
  `~/.tau/credentials.json` (private but not encrypted). OAuth objects may contain
  provider metadata such as a GitHub Enterprise domain and are refreshed
  automatically. Resolution order: stored credential, then the env
  var named by `api_key_env`.
- The selected model must be present in that provider's `models` list. Add
  custom or local model names to `models` before using them as defaults,
  CLI/TUI selections, or scoped models.
- `scoped_models` are favorites for the **Ctrl+P** quick-cycle.
- `providers.json` uses `schema_version: 2` and stores preferences only. Provider
  capabilities—model lists, context windows, transports, metadata, and thinking
  support—always come from the current effective catalog.
- Older `providers.json` files that contain full `providers` entries are migrated
  automatically on first load. Tau keeps the original as `providers.json.bak`,
  moves custom provider definitions to `~/.tau/catalog.toml`, and rewrites
  built-in providers from the current catalog while preserving safe preferences.
  This prevents old model or thinking metadata from hiding capabilities added by
  a Tau upgrade.
- Tau ignores unrecognized preference fields for cross-version compatibility,
  but rejects an unsupported `schema_version` rather than risking a destructive
  rewrite with the wrong format.
- Custom models declare thinking support in `catalog.toml` with
  `thinking_levels`, `thinking_default`, `thinking_models`, and
  `thinking_parameter` (`"reasoning_effort"`, `"reasoning.effort"`, or
  `"anthropic.thinking"`).

Writes after `/login`, `/model`, or scoped-model changes reload the file first,
apply only the requested change, write atomically, and keep a `.bak` backup.

See the [Providers & models guide]({{< relref "../guides/providers-and-models.md" >}}) for usage.

## Shell settings

Tau runs shell commands in a **non-interactive** shell — both terminal-input
commands (`! gst`, `!! ll`) and the agent's `bash` tool. Non-interactive shells
don't load your aliases from `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, and Tau deliberately
never reads those files (they can hold tokens and side effects).

To make your own aliases available, opt in with a `shellCommandPrefix` in
`~/.tau/settings.json` that loads a small Tau-specific alias file:

```bash
# ~/.tau/shell-aliases.bash
alias gst='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit'
```

```json
{
  "shellCommandPrefix": "shopt -s expand_aliases\nsource ~/.tau/shell-aliases.bash"
}
```

Then start a new session and try `! gst`. Notes:

- Commands run through bash-style non-interactive execution, so keep aliases
  POSIX/bash-compatible (zsh-only syntax, functions, or interactive startup
  logic may not work).
- Changing `settings.json` affects **new** sessions; an already-running session
  keeps the prefix it started with.
- The snake_case key `shell_command_prefix` is also accepted.
- Unrecognized fields are ignored for compatibility with newer Tau versions;
  recognized fields remain strictly validated.

## TUI settings

The built-in frontend reads optional settings from `~/.tau/tui.json`:

```json
{
  "theme": "high-contrast",
  "sidebar_position": "right",
  "turn_notification": "desktop",
  "keybindings": {
    "cancel": "escape",
    "command_palette": "ctrl+k",
    "session_picker": "ctrl+r",
    "queue_follow_up": "alt+enter",
    "accept_completion": "tab",
    "completion_next": "down",
    "completion_previous": "up",
    "thinking_cycle": "shift+tab",
    "model_cycle": "ctrl+p",
    "toggle_thinking": "ctrl+t",
    "toggle_tool_results": "ctrl+o",
    "copy_message": "ctrl+c",
    "quit": "ctrl+d"
  }
}
```

Built-in themes: `tau-dark` (default), `tau-light`, `high-contrast`. Custom
themes are JSON files in `~/.tau/themes/` or a project's `.tau/themes/` — see
[Themes]({{< relref "../guides/themes.md" >}}). Set one with `/theme`.
Textual's native theme picker is mapped to the same Tau themes and persists
the same `theme` setting. A configured theme that cannot be found falls back
to `tau-dark` with a startup notice, without overwriting the setting. Keys use
Textual syntax; omitted keys keep their defaults. Tau ignores unrecognized
settings and keybinding names so a `tui.json` written by a newer Tau version does
not prevent an older version from starting. Recognized settings remain strict:
Tau rejects invalid values, empty keys, and duplicate assignments.

- `sidebar_position`: `"right"` (default), `"left"`, or `"off"`. Controls
  placement of the session metadata sidebar. `"off"` hides the sidebar entirely;
  the compact session info row below the prompt still works.
- `turn_notification`: `"desktop"` (default), `"bell"`, or `"off"`. When Tau's
  terminal surface is unfocused and the agent becomes fully idle, `"desktop"`
  selects OSC 9 for Ghostty, iTerm2, and MinTTY, or Kitty's OSC 99 protocol for
  Kitty. Unknown terminals receive no sequence rather than an incompatible one.
  `"bell"` explicitly emits the standard terminal bell so the terminal can mark
  the tab or request attention instead; depending on terminal settings, BEL may
  play a sound. Desktop notifications can also use the operating system's
  configured notification sound. No notification is emitted while Tau has focus.

Full list in [Keyboard shortcuts]({{< relref "./keybindings.md" >}}).

## Sessions

```text
~/.tau/sessions/<cleaned-path>-<short-hash>/
```

Each working directory gets its own subdirectory; transcripts are append-only
JSONL preserving messages, model changes, and the active leaf of the session
tree. Metadata is indexed per project. See the
[Sessions guide]({{< relref "../guides/sessions.md" >}}).

## Skills, prompts & project context

Resource discovery order (later overrides earlier) is documented in
[Skills & prompt templates]({{< relref "../guides/skills-and-prompts.md" >}}) and
[Project instructions]({{< relref "../guides/project-instructions.md" >}}). In short: user-level
`~/.tau` and `~/.agents`, then project-level `.tau` and `.agents`, with
`AGENTS.md` discovered from the project root down to your current directory.

## Context

`/session` reports a rough context estimate and breakdown. Auto-compaction
triggers near the model's context window minus a reserve; override per run with
`--auto-compact-threshold`. Details in [Managing context]({{< relref "../guides/context.md" >}}).
